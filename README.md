# Final-Year-Project
My Final Year Project that explores the application artificial intelligence to infrastructure monitoring


The trained model is in the trained_models folder with test images in the training_images folder

The image_proofs folder shows the records taken at different point in  time. That said the 'Neural Network Training Results' isn't the best due to time constraints when finalizing the model architecture. It contains the training loss and validation loss as well as the training accuracy and validation accurancy for different Convolutional NN models that are slightly different from my finalized model architecture
